Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

* A supervised linear approach to feature extraction
* Transforms to subspace that maximizes class
* Assumes data to normally distributed separability
* Used for dimensionality reduction of features
* Can reduce to of most (number of classes - 1)  components
* scikit -learn i sklearn.discriminant-analysis.Linear Discriminant

Normally distribute => Guassian
Also assumes the data in different classes shares the same covariance as the feature space.
