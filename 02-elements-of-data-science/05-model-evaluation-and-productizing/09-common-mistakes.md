# Common Mistrakes in ML Projects

* You solved the wrong problem. 
    * Assumptions, dependencies... not always straight forward to align business objective with ML problem formulation
* The data was flawed
* The solution didn't scale
    * Keep scale in mind from the beginning
* Final result doesn't match with the prototype's results
    * Be sure to monitor performance on an ongoing basis
* It takes too long to fail
* The solution was too complicated
* There weren't enough allocated engineering resources to try out long-term science ideas
* There was a lack of true collaboration
