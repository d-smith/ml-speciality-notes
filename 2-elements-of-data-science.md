## What is Data Science?

### Introduction to Data Science

What is data science?

* General definition: processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data, either structured or unstructured.
* For the purposes of this course: managing, analyzing, and visualizing data in support of machine learning workflows.

What is machine learning?

* Artificial intelligence machines that improve their predictions by learning from large amounts of input data.

Machine Learning

* Main idea: learning equals estimating underlying function f by mapping data attributes to some target value
* Training set: a set of labeled examples (x, f(x)) where x is the input variable and the label f(x) is the observed target truth
* Goal: given a training set, find approximation <em>p&â€Œ#770;</em>
