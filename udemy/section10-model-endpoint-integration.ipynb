    "* Boto3 SDK\n",
    "* Microservice - Lambda\n",
    "* Microservice - API Gateway - Lambda\n",

    "For the lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a service role for lambda that uses the invoke endpoint policy used earlier\n",
    "* Also need the the lambda basics, logging and put metrics.\n",
    "* Use environment variable to store the prediction endpoint\n",

    "* Client with direct integration with sagemaker endpoint\n",
    "    * SageMaker SDK: python only, can only integration with SageMaker\n",
    "    * SDKs - can integrate with a variety of services beyond SageMaker\n",
    "    * Both expose clients to model and feature transformation specifics - input format, output transformation\n",
    "* Lambda MicroService\n",
    "    * Hide model complexity from clients, encapsulate model transformation\n",
    "    * Numpy support but challenging to work with Pandas (need custom deployment package)\n",
    "* API Gateway and Lambda\n",
    "    * Easier integration for clients via RESTful API\n",
    "    * Same Python limitations"
