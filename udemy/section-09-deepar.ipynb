    "DeepAR Stationary vs Non-Stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classical time series forecasting algorithms expect time series to be stationary (mean, standard deviation are constant over time)\n",
    "    * Requires data transformation to make it stationary\n",
    "* DeepAR does not expect data to be stationary\n",

    "DeepAR vs Classical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classical forecasting methods (ARIMA or ETS) fit a single model to each time series\n",

    "[DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html):\n",

    "* Training set: use entire time series minus the end of the series that makes us the prediction length\n",
    "* Test set has the last number of points covering the prediction length\n",
    "\n",
    "In DeepAR you train on the aggregated time series data, for example in the energy example all customer time series is used for the training. On the prediction side, for one model you would send the customer's time series through to get the prediction for the next set of points.\n",
