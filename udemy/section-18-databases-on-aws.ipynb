    "    * Integrates with S3\n",
    "* NoSQL\n",
    "    * DynamoDB, Cassandra, DocumentDB\n",
    "    * Unlimited scale, single digit millisecond latency\n",

    "    * memcachedd and Redis version\n",
    "* Neptune\n",
    "    * Graph database, optimized for highly connected datasets, querying relationships\n",
    "* TimeStream\n",
    "    * time series database for storing and querying volume timeseries data at 1/10 the cost of relational databases\n",

    "AWS Database Migration Service\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-time data replication\n",
    "* Continuous data replication from on-premises to AWS cloud (and reverse)\n",
    "* Homogenous and heterogenous replication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational Database Service\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* General purpose - can model anything\n",
    "* Rigid schema - difficult to change\n",
    "* SQL - flexible querying method\n",
    "* Complex, requiring specialized skills to administer\n",
    "* Scaling challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "RDS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automates time consuming admin tasks (hardware, installation, patching, backup)\n",
    "* Production ready db in minutes\n",
    "* Push button scaling (cpu, memory, storage)\n",
    "* Six engines \n",
    "\n",
    "HA\n",
    "\n",
    "* Primary in one AZ, Secondary in another AZ\n",
    "* Writes are synchronously replication to both primary and secondary (multi az config)\n",
    "* Primary does down - secondary is promoted to primary\n",
    "* Can configure RDS to backup automatically to S3\n",
    "    * Configurable for retention up to 35 days\n",
    "    * Last restorable time - typically within last 5 minutes\n",
    "    * Point in time restore up to specified second (in a new instance)\n",
    "* Can take snapshot backups to\n",
    "    * User initiated\n",
    "    * Kept until explicitly deleted\n",
    "    * Suitable for long term retention\n",
    "    * Copy to another region\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Read replica\n",
    "    * Supports read only traffic\n",
    "    * Data replicated asynchronously, data can be stale\n",
    "    * One of more replicas based on your engine type\n",
    "    \n",
    "Scaling CPU and Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify desired CPU and memory - RDS takes care of it\n",
    "* Completes in a few minutes (will be an interrupetion in service - RDS performs failover during compute scaling)\n",
    "* Scaling can be scheduled during next maintenance window or applied immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can be scaled without interruption\n",
    "* SQL server up to 16 TB, Aurora up to 64 TB, MySql MariaDB PostgresSQL Oracle up to 32 TB\n",
    "* Can be immediate or scheduled for maint window\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions and Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "* IAM for control plane access\n",
    "* DB specific user for data plane access\n",
    "* Optional encryption at rest using AWS key management service (KMS)\n",
    "* Optional encrypted connection support using TLS\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization, Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameter groups\n",
    "* Guidance via analyzing usage and config\n",
    "* Reserved instances for long term use\n",
    "* Use AWS Config to monitor config drift\n",
    "* CloudWatch for monitoring"
