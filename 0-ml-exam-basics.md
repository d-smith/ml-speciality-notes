infrastructure

## Adoption Benefits

Make the best use of data scientist's time

* 80% of data scientists time spent perparing and managing data for analysis
* ...leaving only 20% of time used to derive insights and business value
* services like AWS glue and athena can be used to prepare and manage data where start up time is minutes not days/weeks/months

Converting the power of ML into business value

* improves business value by streamlining:
    * model training in the cloud
    * model deployent in the cloud and at the edge
* easy to invoke models in production by calling an API

Embedding ML into the business fabric

* value of ml relies on operationalizing models within business applications and processes
* 50% of predictive models don't get implemented
* improve process, minimize manual intervention, and make better decisions using one-click deployment
