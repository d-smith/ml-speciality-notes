# Data Collection

## Machine Learning Cycle

* Generate Example Data
    * Fetch -> Clean -> Prepare
* Train the Model
    * Train model -> Evaluate
* Deploy the model
    * Deploy to prod -> Monitor and Evaluate

Lather, rinse, repeat

## Data Collection Concepts

Before you begin...

* What type of generalization are we seeking
* Do we really need to use ML?
* How will my ML generalization be used
* What do we have to work with?
* How can i tell if the generalization is working?

| Good data | Bad data | Why it matters |
|------|-----|----|
| large datasets | small datasets | More data means better training |
| precise attribute types, feature rich | missing values, nulls | need to train on relevant features |
