# Data Analysis and Visualization

Hans Rosling - famous for showing how insights into data can be ontained via graphics.

* Gapminder

Exam might ask for best graph or visualization for a specific problem.

Seeing Your Data

* Relationships
    * Do we want to find importand relationships in our data?
    * Are there any trends or outliers?
* Comparisons
    * Are we comparing different values within out data?
* Distributions
    * Do we want to know more about the distributions of our data?
    * Are there any outliers?
* Composition
    * Do we want to know what makes up our data?
    * What are the different parts of our data as a whole?

Tools

* Developer - Jupyter notebooks, python libraries, R, etc.
* Business Intelligence Tools - tableau, Amazon QuickSight

## Seeing Your Data Relationships

Visualizing relationships in your data can provide a good general overview, show distribution, and correlation between attributes.Visualizing relationships can also help find outliers and extreme values.

Plot Types

* Scatter Plots - plot points along the x and y axis for two values
    * Example: is there a relationship between 2 values? For example the size of a home and the price
* Bubble plots - plot points along the x and y axis for three values - bubble size represents the third value measured.
    * Is there a relationship between 3 values? For example the size of a home, the age of a home, and the price.

Correlation

* Positive - positive slope
* Negative - negative slope
* Scattered - no correlation

Seeing your Data Comparisons

* Visualizing comparisons in yout data can provide a static snapshot of how different variables compare and show how different variables change over time.

Bar charts - good to lookup and compare different values

* Exampe: comparing the number of star ratings for a mobile application in the app store

Line sharts - use lines to show one or more variables changing over time

* Example: plotting the value of bitcoin over the past 3 years.
