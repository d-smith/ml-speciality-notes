# Data Analysis and Visualization

Hans Rosling - famous for showing how insights into data can be ontained via graphics.

* Gapminder

Exam might ask for best graph or visualization for a specific problem.

Seeing Your Data

* Relationships
    * Do we want to find important relationships in our data?
    * Are there any trends or outliers?
* Comparisons
    * Are we comparing different values within out data?
* Distributions
    * Do we want to know more about the distributions of our data?
    * Are there any outliers?
* Composition
    * Do we want to know what makes up our data?
    * What are the different parts of our data as a whole?

Tools

* Developer - Jupyter notebooks, python libraries, R, etc.
* Business Intelligence Tools - tableau, Amazon QuickSight

## Seeing Your Data Relationships

Visualizing relationships in your data can provide a good general overview, show distribution, and correlation between attributes.Visualizing relationships can also help find outliers and extreme values.

Plot Types

* Scatter Plots - plot points along the x and y axis for two values
    * Example: is there a relationship between 2 values? For example the size of a home and the price
* Bubble plots - plot points along the x and y axis for three values - bubble size represents the third value measured.
    * Is there a relationship between 3 values? For example the size of a home, the age of a home, and the price.

Correlation

* Positive - positive slope
* Negative - negative slope
* Scattered - no correlation

Seeing your Data Comparisons

* Visualizing comparisons in yout data can provide a static snapshot of how different variables compare and show how different variables change over time.

Bar charts - good to lookup and compare different values

* Exampe: comparing the number of star ratings for a mobile application in the app store

Line charts - use lines to show one or more variables changing over time

* Example: plotting the value of bitcoin over the past 3 years.

## Seeing Your Data Distribution

Visualizing distributions in your data can show how your data is grouped or clustered over certain intervals.

Techniques

* Histograms
    * These graphs put values into buckets or bins and determines a measurement (frequency, amount, duration, density, etc)
    * Bins - number of groups to visualize
* Box Plots
    * These graphs show a wealth of distribution information. You can see things like lowest and highest values, outliers, and where most of the values fall.
    * Top and bottom lines are max and min values, median line in the box, extreme values and outliers. Box shows where the majority of the values fall. Top quartile, middle quartile, bottom quartile.
* Scatter Plots
    * These graphs plot points along the x and y axis for two values.
    * Date along the x axis

## Composition

Visualizing composition of your data show the various elements and what your data is made of.

Three visualizations to view the composition of your data.

* Pie Charts - show how various values compare as a whole, share of the total
    * Example - sales figures for each region
* Stacked area charts - stacked area charts shows the measurement of various items over longer periods of time
    * Example - showing number of products sold by different departments on a weekly basis
* Stacked Column Charts - show quantity of various items over shorter periods of time
    * Showing quarterly revenue totals for each region

Choosing a Visualization

* Picking the right viz depeands on what you want to see.

| What you want to see. | What to use |
| -- | -- |
| Relationship | scatter plot (2 variables), bubble chart ( 3 variables) |
| Comparison | bar chart (value look ups), line chart (change over time) |
| Distribution | single: histogram, multi: box-plot, scatter plot |
| Composition | changing over time: stacked bar, stack area, static: pie chart |

Heatmaps

* Graphs that represent values as color. As the value changes the color representation of the data changes.
* Heatmaps are a great way to show correlation and compare values to other values

## Exam Tips

Data Analysis and Visualization

* Know what it is and why it is important
* Understand what quicksight is and how it can be used
* Be able to recognize different types of viz and what each represents
    * relationships, comparisons, distribution, composition
* Know what heatmaps are and what they can represent
